Here are the files at left: 

1. **index.html** is the web page that chooses the script file to run. **Don't edit it.**
2. **devcontainer.json** loads the MS Preview app for CodeSpaces.
3. **petkata.js** is where the instructions are
4. **script.js** is where you build and test your code.

##NEW COMMANDS##

1. **confirm** is like prompt, but it offers OK & Cancel, which store true or false (or 1 or 0, or yes or no) in the targeted boolean variable.
2. **boolean expressions** resolve to true or false.  The comparatives are duplicates, like in Mastermind: && and || and == (or <, >, <= or >=)
3. **conditionals** - if, else if, and else determine "logical flow", like a pinball machine (if lever is up, go in this channel, else that one).
